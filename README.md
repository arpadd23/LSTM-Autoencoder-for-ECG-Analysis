# LSTM Autoencoder for ECG Analysis
## 📈 Overview
Welcome to the LSTM Autoencoder for ECG Analysis project! This repository contains an advanced machine learning workflow to analyze heart rhythm patterns using a recurrent autoencoder, determining which patterns indicate healthy or unhealthy conditions.

## 🛠️ Features
◆ Data Preparation
Downloads and prepares ECG data for analysis using the provided Python script.

Uses the ecg_sample_df.pkl for sample data, which represents different heart rhythms.

◆ Model Architecture
Implements a LSTM-based encoder and decoder to learn and reconstruct heart rhythm patterns.

Evaluates heart rhythms based on the reconstruction loss, using a threshold to identify normal vs. abnormal rhythms.

◆ Prediction & Evaluation
Executes the model to predict and evaluate heart rhythms.

Outputs a binary list indicating healthy (0) or unhealthy (1) conditions for each analyzed pattern.

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses a dataset of ECG samples that contains 10 different heart rhythm patterns, providing a diverse set of data for analysis and model training.
